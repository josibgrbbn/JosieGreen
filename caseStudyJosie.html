            Effectiveness claim: I think the most effective feature is professors now being able to post comments responding to students evaluations. This encourages professors to read these evaluations and gain understanding of the experiences of students in their classes. 
            Explanation: Originally only students could post evaluations on this site, and professors had no way to respond. I think this makes professors more likely to disregard the student's opinions. Now that they can post their own responses they are more likely to read through the comments about their class. This creates important discourse and also could help professors improve their course for future students.

            Use of tech claim: Technology helps with root causes to this problem by creating a platform that is accessable to many students and teachers. 
            Explanation: Creating an account to either post a comment or do research for potential classes is free to all. There are ratings for over 1.3 million professors at 7000 different schools. This wide-spread access to this forum allows evaluation and discourse about courses to be done by a wide variety of students.

            Implications for my actual project: The general idea of a site for teacher evaluation can be used for our project, while also looking at problems with this forum to know what to avoid in our own project. 
            Explanation: This site has been a huge success for students to easily gain information on classes and for teachers to get feedback. It only applies to college students which gives us a good oppurtunity to create something similiar for younger students
