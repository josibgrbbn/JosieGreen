                <h3 class="display-6 text center fs-3"> Lack of understanding and negative assumptions from teachers being made because of race lead to students of color more often being affected by negative student teacher relationships. 
                </h3>
                
                <div class="col">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Evidence:"Research typically ﬁnds that minority students experience less close (and potentially more dependant) student–teacher relationships than their non-minority peers (e.g. Ladd, Birch, & Buhs, 1999; Wyrick & Rudasill, 2009). In the United States, for example, teachers report less positive student–teacher relationships with African American and Hispanic students than with Caucasian students … Although it is likely that poor quality, ethnically divergent relationships reﬂect weak understandings about one another-her’s cultures (Thijs et al., 2012); in some cases, language may also contribute” 
                      (Who when why and to what end? Students at risk of negative student teacher relationships and their outcomes.)

                  <ul>
                  <li> Explanation: This supports my claim because it highlights the lack of understanding that is leading to this issue. When students are a different race or ethnicity than their teachers this can lead to a cultural divide, which most often affects students of color because the majority of teachers are white. White teachers having a more distant relationship with these students could also lead to more projection of their own racial biases because they don’t know the student as well. 
                    </li>

                  <div class="text-center">
                    <ul>
                    <li> Implications for effective solutions: This is important for teachers to know in order to make a conscious effort to connect with all students regardless of race. One effective solution could be educating teachers on this data so they are more aware. Another solution would be students being more educated on cultures other than their own in general, so they can have more understanding of students.

                          <ul>
                            <li>Evidence: “There are a number of environmental factors that may contribute to a student behaving unfavorably. For example, they may ﬁnd schoolwork too diﬃcult, have an unstable family life, or feel frustrated with their teacher…. Temperament can be understood as consistent individual differences in “biological mechanisms and their behavioral con-sequences“ (Rothbart & Posner, 2005, p. 102). Students with different temperaments therefore demonstrate different abilities to control their reactivity to stimulation (Rothbart & Posner, 2005). Temperament is widely thought to be genetic (Grist &McCord, 2010), relatively stable through childhood (Rothbart & Posner, 2005), and predictive of personality in early adult-hood (Caspi & Silva, 1995).”

                          <li> Explanation: Although it may seem obvious that behavioral issues lead to negative student teacher relationships, it is important to emphasize because it is another barrier stopping students and teachers from connecting in a beneficial way. The environmental factors causing the student to behave in this way are often out of their control, and they deserve to still have positive experiences in the classroom. Finding better solutions to behavioral issues can benefit students and teachers.

                            <li> Implications for effective solutions: To help improve student teacher relationships we need better systems to deal with behavioral problems among students. Instead of short term punishment we need to have better mental health services and counseling to get to the root of why students are acting out in school.
